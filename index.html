                        hour-
                        long session more than $100 USD. In other words, the traditional way of a child’s test
                        preparation
                        will cost you, the parent, $1500 USD. According to research, 70% of study time with a tutor is
                        used to determine the gaps in the student’s basic knowledge. When you do the math, you see that
                        70% of the
                        time
                        spent with the tutor on just figuring out the student’s weak points translates into $1050 USD.
